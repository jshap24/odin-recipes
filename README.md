Project: Recipes
Reflection on Project: I spent about 2 hours on this project, and the speed with which I was using HTML tags kept increasing throughout the project.  For the first recipe, I had to check with the assignment page. With the second recipe, I was able to resolve errors and felt incredibly satisfied when I would save in VSCode and refresh my browser, and voila, a beautiful webpage with simple and clear content. Feeling grateful to be following a great curriculum laid out by TOP.

I am becoming more comfortable with Git, as well as HTML tags. I know that I am still learning, but I feel that I have superpowers now, and I am looking forward to moving on to CSS soon.
