    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Tzatziki is one of my favorite dips to make in the summer, because it is so refreshing and light. Although it has the same color as a dip like ranch or french onion dip, it is entirely different in flavor and texture. It's simple to make, requiring only seven ingredients. The recipe takes about fifteen minutes in total, which makes it great for a last minute snack when you are craving something healthy and light.

        The base ingredients are Greek yogurt and cucumber.  I prefer using full fat (5%) Greek yogurt, but the recipe would work with nonfat Greek yogurt as well. One time, I had cucumbers and the rest of the ingredients, but no Greek yogurt, and I made it with normal plain yogurt. The result was still delicious!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 grated cucumber</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups plain Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint or dill</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 medium clove garlic, pressed</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Working with one big handful at a time, lightly squeeze the grated cucumber to remove excess moisture.  You can also do this with a cheesecloth.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining ingredients (yogurt, olive oil, herbs, lemon juice, garlic, and salt) to the bowl, and stir to blend. Let the mixture rest for five or more minutes. Taste and add additional chopped fresh herbs, lemon juice, or salt, if necessary. </li>
        <li>Serve immediately or chill for later.</li>
